# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jordan (He/Him) :gb: and I'm a student studying _Data Science & Analytics_ at [Bournemouth University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth_University) :mortar_board:. Prior to studying at BU, I studied Cyber Security at Bristol UWE before deciding to switch to data science. I'm currently on my placement (junior) year where I work at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory) in the [San Francisco Bay Area](https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Francisco+Bay+Area) :us:. At the lab, I work with teams of incredible scientists and researchers on open research projects involving solving problems using neural networks and deep learning.

It's here, during both work and my free time where I have written most of my software.

- I've contributed towards `inference-engine`, a neural network inference framework written in [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) that is deployed in [ICAR](https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/intermediate-complexity-atmospheric-research-icar), an accelerated atmospheric simulation model.
- **`REDACTED`** is a Python project of mine which **`REDACTED`**.
- [`jutils`](https://github.com/JordanWelsman/jutils), another project of mine collects many useful utilities I've written and used in some of my other data science and Python projects for other people to use.
